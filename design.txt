An inventory system for your home
(eventual integration with a recipe finder / assembler)
will read from a file for name and amounts of items (psql database later)

Roadmap:
	command line tool to edit a csv file
	command line tool to edit a database
	OR
	GUI tool to edit a csv file
	GUI tool to edit a database

	recipe functionality is separate

command line tool to update item amounts / get information
	inv [item] [+/-x]	item: new amount

	inv [item] 		item: amount
				used in: recipe name


Run:
opens / creates csv file
loads contents into structs
enters command switch structure
	consider allowing for multiple modes per operation so theyre processed as a list
save command loads struct list back into file

For database based systems its good practice to keep the same connection to the database open, and pass that around

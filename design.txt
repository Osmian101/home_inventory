An inventory system for your home
(eventual integration with a recipe finder / assembler)
will read from a file for name and amounts of items (psql database later)

Roadmap:
	command line tool to edit a csv file
	command line tool to edit a database
	OR
	GUI tool to edit a csv file
	GUI tool to edit a database

	recipe functionality is separate

command line tool to update item amounts / get information
	inv [item] [+/-x]	item: new amount

	inv [item] 		item: amount
				used in: recipe name


Run: (scrapped)
opens / creates csv file
loads contents into structs
enters command switch structure
	consider allowing for multiple modes per operation so theyre processed as a list
save command loads struct list back into file

Run:
loads file into struct list
loops while not receiving the quit command

For database based systems its good practice to keep the same connection to the database open, and pass that around
